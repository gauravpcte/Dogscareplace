					<h3>SKIN INFECTIONS</h3>
					<p>Chamomile, calendula, and green tea have properties that soothe and cool irritated skin. These soaks are best for dogs who have hot, itchy patches of skin that are at risk of getting rubbed raw.
					If your dog is inconsolably itchy all over, fill up your tub or sink with warm water and let several herbal tea bags steep for three minutes. Remove the tea bags and let your dog soak in the bath for at least five minutes.
					Alternatively, for smaller itchy patches, steep one or two tea bags in about two cups of hot water. Once the tea is cooled down, pour it on your dog’s skin as a quick fix, letting it drip dry without rinsing.</p>
